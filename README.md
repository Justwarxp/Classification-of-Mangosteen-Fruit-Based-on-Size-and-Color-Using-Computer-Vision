# Classification-of-Mangosteen-Fruit-Based-on-Size-and-Color-Using-Computer-Vision

This is my final project, where I aim to develop a mangosteen sorting device using artificial intelligence and computer vision. The device will categorize mangosteen based on its color and size. The research location is in Bali, Tabanan, Pupuan Galiukir, a region known for its abundance of mangosteen, salak (snake fruit), coffee, cocoa, durian, and cloves.
